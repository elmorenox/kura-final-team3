## Purpose


## Jenkins Infrastructure
Jenkins stands out as a versatile open-source automation server known for its flexible CI/CD pipelines. With an expansive plugin ecosystem, Jenkins seamlessly integrates with various tools and facilitates distributed builds, optimizing efficiency, especially for large-scale projects. Jenkins' platform independence and active community contribute to its enduring popularity.

## Terraform
Terraform, an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, simplifies infrastructure management with its declarative configuration language. It supports multiple cloud providers and enables efficient provisioning. Due to Terraform's capabilities, the automation of provisioning becomes straightforward, allowing for seamless and consistent deployment of infrastructure resources.

## EKS and Kubernetes
EKS, the managed Kubernetes service from AWS, provides a scalable and secure platform for running containerized applications. Seamlessly integrating with various AWS services, EKS simplifies the deployment and management of containerized workloads.

Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform, automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Streamlining the development and deployment of microservices, Kubernetes goes beyond orchestration. It can handle the creation of underlying infrastructure components, including EC2 instances and security groups, offering a comprehensive solution for managing containerized workloads.

## Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a script used to create Docker containers. It contains instructions to assemble a Docker image, specifying the base image, application code, dependencies, and configurations. Dockerfiles enable consistent and reproducible builds, ensuring that applications run consistently across different environments.
